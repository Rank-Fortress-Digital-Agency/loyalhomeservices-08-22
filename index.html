                    SEAL ANY CRACKS OR GAPS AROUND YOUR HOME’S DOORS AND WINDOWS.
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <div class="two-col">
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            A lot of heat escapes from homes through these tiny openings, so if you seal them up tight, you can prevent a lot of that heat from escaping. You can use caulk to seal around windows and door frames, which will help <a href="https://www.loyalhomeservices.com/furnace-repair-how-to-keep-your-home-warm-this-winter/">keep the heat in your home</a>. You can also use weather-stripping around doors to help seal them tight.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Adding <a href="https://www.loyalhomeservices.com/home-services-san-antonio/attic-insulation/">insulation to your walls and attic</a> will help keep the heat from escaping through those areas. You can also add a barrier to your windows to help keep the heat in. There are many different types of window film that you can purchase that will do this job well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One last thing you can do to keep the heat in your home is to ensure you have proper ventilation. Having a sound ventilation system in place will help to circulate the <a href="https://www.loyalhomeservices.com/air-quality-services-keep-you-and-your-family-safe/">air and keep</a> the temperature in your home even. You can get a professional to help you with this or do it yourself. Ensure that you have the proper ventilation, so your home doesn’t get too hot or too cold.
                        </p>

                    INSTALL INSULATION IN YOUR ATTIC AND CRAWL SPACES.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Again, this is an easy way to <a href="https://www.loyalhomeservices.com/keep-your-a-c-running-smooth-all-summer/">keep heat from escaping from your home and will also help keep your home cooler in the summer</a>. In the winter, you can open up your windows to let in some fresh air; in the summer, you can close them to keep the heat out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another easy way to improve your home’s energy efficiency is to ensure that you have weather stripping around your doors and windows. This will help to keep the cold air from coming in and the warm air from escaping. You can also use caulk to seal any cracks or gaps that you may have in your home. These are just a few things you can do to make your home more energy efficient. If you are unsure how to do these things, you may want to hire a professional to help you.

                    CONSIDER SWITCHING TO ENERGY-EFFICIENT LIGHT BULBS.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    These days, many different types of energy-efficient light bulbs are available on the market, and they can save you a lot of money in the long run. CFLs, or compact fluorescent light bulbs, are one energy-efficient light bulb that has become increasingly popular in recent years. LED bulbs are another energy-efficient light bulb that is also becoming more popular.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want to save money on your energy bill, switching to energy-efficient light bulbs is a good idea. CFLs and LEDs use less electricity than traditional incandescent bulbs, saving you money over time. In addition, CFLs and LEDs last much longer than incandescent bulbs, so you won’t have to replace them as often.
                </p>

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">
                    USE A PROGRAMMABLE THERMOSTAT.
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A programmable thermostat allows you to set specific times for your heating or cooling system to turn on or off. This way, you can ensure that your system is only running when you need it to, not when you are not home or when everyone is asleep. By programming your thermostat, you can save money on your energy bills and keep your home at a comfortable temperature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a few things to consider when choosing a programmable thermostat for your home. The first is whether you want a digital or analog model. Digital models typically offer more features and options than analog models, but they can be more expensive. If you are unsure which type of thermostat to buy, ask a salesperson for help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next thing to consider is the size of the thermostat. Some models are designed for small spaces, while others are meant for larger homes. If you have a large house, you will need a model that can handle the square footage.
                </p>

                            GET YOUR HVAC SYSTEM SERVICED REGULARLY.
                        </h2>
                        <hr>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            This is one tip that many people forget, but it is essential. Getting your HVAC system regularly serviced (at least once a year) will help keep it running efficiently, saving you money on your energy bills, and help extend your system’s life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, be sure to change your air filters regularly – at least every three months – to keep the air in your home clean and to help your system run more efficiently. Don’t forget about your ceiling fans, too! Be sure they are set to rotate clockwise in the summer (push the switch up) to help circulate the cool air generated by your air conditioner. And in the winter, switch them to rotate counterclockwise (push the button down) to help distribute the warm air from your heater.

                <h2>
                    MAKE SURE THAT YOUR HOME IS WELL-VENTILATED.
                </h2>

                <br>
                <p>
                    Good ventilation helps remove excess heat and moisture from your home, making it more comfortable, and also helps to prevent mold and mildew from growing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a few things you can do to help improve the ventilation in your home:
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Open windows and doors when weather permits
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Use fans to circulate air
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Install an exhaust fan in your kitchen and bathroom
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Make sure your dryer is vented outside
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Clean your air conditioner filter regularly

                <h2>
                    USE FANS WISELY.
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Fans can be a great way to cool down your home without using your air conditioner, saving you a lot of money. Just be sure to use them wisely – for example, ceiling fans should only be used when people are in the room, and they should be turned off when everyone leaves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other ways to reduce your cooling costs include:
                </p>
                <p>
                    – planting trees or shrubs to provide shade around your home
                </p>
                <p>
                    – installing reflective film on your windows
                </p>
                <p>
                    – using awnings or blinds to block out the sun’s rays
                </p>
                <p>
                    – insulating your home to keep the heat out
                </p>
                <p>
                    – Use fans wisely – for example, ceiling fans should only be used when people are in the room and should be turned off when everyone leaves.
